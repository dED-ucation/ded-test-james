# Next.js + Jest

## This project uses Jest with NextJs for testing

Following the instructions from the Readme file on the Main branch of this project, a next js application was created to mimic the expected behavior of the application. In doing so, this script has only one components under pages which is used for testing.
As for the testing locate __tests___ folder and select the index file inside pages folder. This is where the entire script for testing is located.

The Testing is splitted into three faces
